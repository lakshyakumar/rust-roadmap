# System Design Questions

This folder contains a comprehensive set of system design interview questions, segmented by topic and difficulty. Use these to practice, prepare, or guide discussions for intermediate to expert-level system design interviews.

## General Guidelines for System Design Solutions

For every system design question, address the following:

1. **Requirements & Constraints**
   - Functional and non-functional requirements (scale, latency, availability, durability, cost)
   - Estimate scale (users, QPS, data size, growth rate)
2. **High-Level Architecture**
   - Request flow (client ‚Üí load balancer ‚Üí app servers ‚Üí DB ‚Üí cache ‚Üí storage)
3. **Data Model & Storage**
   - Relational vs NoSQL, sharding, partitioning, replication, indexing
4. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Horizontal/vertical scaling, caching (CDN, Redis, Memcached)
5. **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**
   - Failover, replication, backups, CAP theorem
6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching strategies, query optimization, batching, async/event-driven
7. **Security & Compliance**
   - Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, data privacy, encryption
8. **Trade-offs**
   - SQL vs NoSQL, consistency vs availability, monolith vs microservices
